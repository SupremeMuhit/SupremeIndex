# Boruto Filler List

Many people dislike Boruto due to its large number of episodes and believe its story is poor. However, this is not entirely accurate. While Boruto: Naruto Next Generations may be boring for some, **the second part, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex (also known as Boruto TBV), is better than (I think) Naruto.**
